# Python-with-Mosh
I'm learning Python and this course with Mosh seems to make the most sense to me. I've been working on Python off and on for the last couple of years. It's a challenge, but I really love it when someting I've learned sinks in. 

Everything is synced from the PyCharm IDE and I plan to complete this 6 hour course, one way or the other.
